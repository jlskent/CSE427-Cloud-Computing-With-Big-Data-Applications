In HW 3 there are problems like running a sample MapReduce job, problems about skew and MapReduce architecture. I think for for hadoop/ environment problems it would help if we have more small questions, even they are not necessarily need to be answered. Also, I sometimes find that if a problem does not have a specific answer, it is hard to describe.At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 2 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 4 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 2 stars.
