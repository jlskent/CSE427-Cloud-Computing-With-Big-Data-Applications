*********review of HW1*************

The workload of homework 1 is reasonable. And I think it contains various types of problems, including reading, concepts and some math problems, which is good. Problem 1 is good enough and helps understand concepts of defining big-data. Some contents from the questions have ambiguous boundaries, and hopefully they don’t have strict answers. For problem 2 is brief and perfect. And it is nice to have a table to test out the solution. For problem 3, the article is well-written with the topic of speech recognition and machine translation. It is generally good. However, although given the opportunity of understanding data-mining notions through this specific topic, it may not be the easiest example for getting a grasp of these concepts appeared in this problem. For example, when I tried to look at the paper with specific questions in mind or tried to search the key word “data-based”, it is hard to find the information I need. So overall, I will rate the homework 1 as 4 stars out of 5.
