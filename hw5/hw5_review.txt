Hw5 is about secondary sort, comparators and creating index file for the whole task. This assignment has better instructions compared to last one. Also the knowledge is helpful. And For some questions I think the idea is clear but it does not make too much sense in reality, for example, the reasonable way to change the output order is through comparators. 

At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 2 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 4 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 2 stars. In terms of clarity of instruction, I will give 4 stars.
