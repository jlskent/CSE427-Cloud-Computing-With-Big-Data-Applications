HW 8 is an exercise about pig and spark. I think these are helpful because they are really the contemporary tools that we use now. However, I think if there is a comprehensive instruction, it would be easier to follow the process. It is always a good idea to have a good documentation of the tools we use step by step. Also, I think we should work a little more on spark and pig compared to hadoop. Because some of the previous assignments on hadoop are similar and spark and pig are quite important.

At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 4 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 4 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 4 stars. In terms of clarity of instruction, I will give 3 stars.
