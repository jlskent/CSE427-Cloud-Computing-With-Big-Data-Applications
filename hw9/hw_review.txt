Hw9 is mostly about spark jobs and a little of page-rank algorithm. So I think they are helpful in terms of understanding the rddâ€™s transformations and spark jobs. However there are two suggestions to make it even better. One is that the instruction of this time is not as precise as previous ones. For example, there are some warnings when following the set-ups. The other one would be that it would be better if we had one homework that gives us a good understanding of the overall workflow of a real-life-like task.

At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 3 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 3 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 2 stars. In terms of clarity of instruction, I will give 3 stars.
