For Scala users:
You will have to compile your Scala program first. Here is one way to achieve this: Go to the following directory in your VM:

$DEV1/exercices/spark-application/countjpgs

Copy your Scala program into the src/main/scala folder in this directory.
Now, run the following two commands:

sudo service archiva start

and then

mvn package

This invokes Apache Maven to compile your program with all required dependencies. You should now find a folder called target and within this folder you get your .jar file.

Trouble-shooting:
- make sure you have a file called pom.xml in your countjpg folder.
- To submit your job add the package to refer to your program:
-- class solution.CountJPG
