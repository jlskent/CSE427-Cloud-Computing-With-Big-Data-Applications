This is  mostly about learning a easy topN list. The homework is mostly the content of the related lab. It is an easy assignment but we are able to have hands-on experience on implementing chaining jobs of the topic. There is also a good review of implementation since we are mostly doing it from scratch. Also there is review of previous concepts like combiners.


At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 3 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 3 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 3 stars. In terms of clarity of instruction, I will give 5 stars.
