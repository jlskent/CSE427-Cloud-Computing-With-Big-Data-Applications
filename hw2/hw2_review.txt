Homework 2 is about basic set-ups about HFDS in VM and basic concepts of the DFS system as well as Mapreduce process. So for problem 1, Although it is suitable for the start, I think it is too easy to work on. It is not supposed to be difficult for problems like these, but I think it will be better if we more questions on problem 1. Because the goal here is to get familiar with hadoop commands. For non-command questions, I think it can be a good way if we have multiple choice questions.

So, from this time I will try to rate the homework in 3 aspects, which can be a good idea statistically. In terms of time consumption, I will give 2 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 4 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 2 stars.
